#Overview

Build Status:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dj-wasabi/ansible-zabbix-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dj-wasabi/ansible-zabbix-agent)

This is an role for installing and maintaining the zabbix-agent.

This is one of the 'dj-wasabi' roles which configures your whole zabbix environment. See an list for the complete list:

 * zabbix-server (https://galaxy.ansible.com/dj-wasabi/zabbix-server/)
 * zabbix-proxy (https://galaxy.ansible.com/dj-wasabi/zabbix-proxy/)
 * zabbix-javagateway (https://galaxy.ansible.com/dj-wasabi/zabbix-javagateway/)
 * zabbix-agent (https://galaxy.ansible.com/dj-wasabi/zabbix-agent/)

## Upgrade

### 0.8.0

As of version 0.8.0, the property `zabbix_api_use` isn't available anymore. It is replaced by the properties `zabbix_api_create_hostgroup` and `zabbix_api_create_hosts`

#Requirements
##Operating systems
This role will work on the following operating systems:

## Zabbix API
When you want to automatically create the hosts in the webinterface, you'll need on your own machine the zabbix-api package. 

You can install this locally with the following command: `pip install zabbix-api`.

This ansible role uses the modules from "Cove" found in this pull request: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/44. So all credits goes to this guy!

#Installation

Installing this role is very simple: `ansible-galaxy install dj-wasabi.zabbix-agent`

#Role Variables

## Main variables
There are some variables in de default/main.yml which can (Or needs to) be changed/overriden:

* `agent_server`: The ipaddress for the zabbix-server or zabbix-proxy.

* `agent_serveractive`: The ipaddress for the zabbix-server or zabbix-proxy for active checks.

#Dependencies

There are no dependencies on other roles.

#Example Playbook

## agent_interfaces

This will configure the Zabbix Agent interface on the host. 
```
agent_interfaces:
  - type: 1
    main: 1
    useip: "{{ zabbix_useuip }}"
    ip: "{{ agent_ip }}"
    dns: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
    port: "{{ agent_listenport }}"
```

## Other interfaces

You can also configure the `agent_interfaces` to add/configure snmp, jmx and ipmi interfaces.

You'll have to use one of the following type numbers when configuring it:

| Type Interface  |  Nr   |
|-----------------|-------|
| Zabbix Agent  | 1  |
| snmp | 2  |
| jmx  | 3  |
| ipmi | 4  |

Configuring a snmp interface will look like this:

```
agent_interfaces:
  - type: 2
    main: 1
    useip: "{{ zabbix_useuip }}"
    ip: "{{ agent_ip }}"
    dns: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
    port: "{{ agent_listenport }}"
```

##Vars in role configuration
Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: all
      roles:
         - role: dj-wasabi.zabbix-agent
           agent_server: 192.168.33.30
           agent_serveractive: 192.168.33.30
           zabbix_url: http://zabbix.example.com
           zabbix_api_use: true
           zabbix_api_user: Admin
           zabbix_api_pass: zabbix
           zabbix_create_host: present
           zabbix_host_groups:
             - Linux Servers
           zabbix_link_templates:
             - Template OS Linux
             - Apache APP Template
           zabbix_macros:
             - macro_key: apache_type
               macro_value: reverse_proxy

##Combination of group_vars and playbook 
You can also use the group_vars or the host_vars files for setting the variables needed for this role. File you should change: `group_vars/all` or `host_vars/<zabbix_server>` (Where <zabbix_server> is the hostname of the machine running Zabbix Server)

		agent_server: 192.168.33.30
        agent_serveractive: 192.168.33.30
        zabbix_url: http://zabbix.example.com
        zabbix_api_use: true
        zabbix_api_user: Admin
        zabbix_api_pass: zabbix
        zabbix_create_host: present
        zabbix_host_groups:
          - Linux Servers
        zabbix_link_templates:
          - Template OS Linux
          - Apache APP Template
        zabbix_macros:
          - macro_key: apache_type
            macro_value: reverse_proxy

and in the playbook only specifying:

    - hosts: all
      roles:
         - role: dj-wasabi.zabbix-agent

#Molecule

This roles is configured to be tested with Molecule. You can find on this page some more information regarding Molecule: https://werner-dijkerman.nl/2016/07/10/testing-ansible-roles-with-molecule-testinfra-and-docker/
Molecule will boot 3 docker containers, containing the following OS:

* Debian 8
* CentOS 7
* Ubuntu 14.04

On these containers, this Ansible role is executed. After this, a idempotence check is run.
When all is executed correctly, TestInfra is executed to validate the installation/configuration.

#Extra Information

You can install so-called userparameter files by adding the following into your roles:

```
- name: "Installing sample file"
  copy: src=sample.conf
        dest="{{ agent_include }}/mysql.conf"
        owner=zabbix
        group=zabbix
        mode=0755
  notify: restart zabbix-agent
```

Example of the "sample.conf" file:

```
UserParameter=mysql.ping_to,mysqladmin -uroot ping | grep -c alive
```

You can extend your zabbix configuration by adding items yourself that do specific checks which aren't in the zabbix core itself. You can change offcourse the name of the file to whatever you want (Same for the UserParameter line(s) ;-) 

(Maybe in near future doing it with variables.)
